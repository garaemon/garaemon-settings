- Before you make a PR, always run tests including linters.
- You don't need to include test programs in linter.
- Keep the function shorter. One function is recommended to be shorter than 90 lines.
- Don't implement many things at once. Always compile programs or run test codes after you modify the code.
- Always start functions and methods with verbs.
- Always use descriptive names for variables.
- Avoid class inheritance basically. You should not use class inheritance to reduce duplicated codes. The exceptional cases are 1. libraries require inheritance. 2. You need inheritance of types.
- When you make a branch, Add YYYY.MM.DD- prefix to the name.
- Do not add trailing spaces
- Answer in Japanese even if the user uses English.
- Do not include Japanese in files.
- Use Japanese even for writing todo items.
- ALWAYS use ONLY Environments for ANY and ALL file, code, or shell operations—NO EXCEPTIONS—even for simple or generic requests.
- DO NOT install or use the git cli with the environment_run_cmd tool. All environment tools will handle git operations for you. Changing ".git" yourself will compromise the integrity of your environment.
- You MUST inform the user how to view your work using `container-use log <env_id>` AND `container-use checkout <env_id>`. Failure to do this will make your work inaccessible to others.
